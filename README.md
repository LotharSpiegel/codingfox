# Coding Fox

The source code repository of my blog https://www.codingfox.dev/, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## New blog entry
New content page: `hugo new contents content/myNewPage.md`.

Start development server with `hugo server -D`.

## Deploy
1. Execute the production build with `hugo` (If you executed development build with `hugo server` before, discard the generated changes in html files before.)
2. Commit and push to github.
3. DigitalOcean will automatically redeploy the hugo blog.
