A list of my favourite coffee places I've visited. A highly subjective matter.
It goes without saying: if you want to know how good a coffee is, you order an Espresso.
If you read a review on Google Maps containing entitled complaints about the coffee shop but displays a photo with a Cappuccino,
you can safely ignore this review ;)

Cute little coffee place. Always well visited, most regulars just get a coffee to go. I like the "back to the basics" style. If you wanna have brunch with your huge group of besties and talk for 3 hours while drinking a Flat white with soy milk, go somewhere else ;) 

Recommended order: Salmon avocado bread (much tastier than in your regular hipster café) with espresso (they serve one of the best in europe in my opinion).
