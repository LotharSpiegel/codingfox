A list of my favourite coffee places I've visited. A highly subjective matter.
It goes without saying: if you want to know how good a coffee is, you order an Espresso.
If you read a review on Google Maps containing entitled complaints about the coffee shop but displays a photo with a Cappuccino,
you can safely ignore this review ;)

## Andalusia
### Málaga

#### [Next Level Speciality Coffee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Next+Level+Specialty+Coffee/@36.7177751,-4.4241464,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xd72f75b32420fdf:0x3696e7a76b550c70!8m2!3d36.7177751!4d-4.4241464!16s%2Fg%2F11fvk304_g?authuser=0&hl=en&entry=ttu)
Cute little coffee place. Always well visited, most regulars just get a coffee to go. I like the "back to the basics" style. If you wanna have brunch with your huge group of besties and talk for 3 hours while drinking a Flat white with soy milk, go somewhere else ;) 

Recommended order: Salmon avocado bread (much tastier than in your regular hipster café) with espresso. They serve one of the best in europe in my opinion.

## Hungary
### Budapest

#### [Beyond Within Specialty Kávé Pörkölő](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beyond+Within+Specialty+K%C3%A1v%C3%A9+P%C3%B6rk%C3%B6l%C5%91/@47.5073998,19.0467786,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4741ddd2e209c61f:0x8bcf1868d1b6766f!8m2!3d47.5073998!4d19.0493535!16s%2Fg%2F11fhv875rx?entry=ttu)
